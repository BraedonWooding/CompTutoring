# Week 2

Welcome to Week 2 of 1521.  Make sure your computer is all setup (check the home computing section on the left).

## Q1) Int Types

```c
#include <stdint.h>

             // range of values for type
             //             minimum               maximum
int8_t   i1; //                 -128                  127
uint8_t  i2; //                    0                  255
int16_t  i3; //               -32768                32767
uint16_t i4; //                    0                65535
int32_t  i5; //          -2147483648           2147483647
uint32_t i6; //                    0           4294967295
int64_t  i7; // -9223372036854775808  9223372036854775807
uint64_t i8; //                    0 18446744073709551615
```

## Q3) Math

Taking the following;

```c
uint16_t a = 0x5555, b = 0xAAAA, c = 0x0001;
```

Do the following giving result in hex (though do it in binary).

1. `a |  b` (bitwise OR)
2. `a &  b` (bitwise AND)
3. `a ^  b` (bitwise XOR)
4. `a & ~b` (bitwise AND, bitwise NOT)
5. `c << 6` (logical left shift)
6. `a >> 4` (logical right shift)
7. `a &  (b << 1)` (bitwise and, logical left shift)
8. `b |  c` (bitwise or)
9. `a & ~c` (bitwise and, bitwise not)

### Side Question, logical vs arithmetic shifts vs rotation

?> What's a Logical Shift?  Rotation?  Arithmetic Shift?

This is for `x << n` or `x >> n`.  And where `INT_MAX` represents the largest value for `x`

| Direction  |   Type   |  x  | Result                   |
| ---------- | -------- | --- | ------------------------ |
| Right (>>) | unsigned | ≥ 0 | ⌊x / 2ⁿ⌋                 |
| Right (>>) |  signed  | ≥ 0 | ⌊x / 2ⁿ⌋                 |
| Right (>>) |  signed  | < 0 | Implementation-defined † |
| Left  (<<) | unsigned | ≥ 0 | (x * 2ⁿ) % (INT_MAX + 1) |
| Left  (<<) |  signed  | ≥ 0 | (x * 2ⁿ) ††              |
| Left  (<<) |  signed  | < 0 | (x * 2ⁿ) ††              |

If `n` is negative at all the result is undefined, it's also undefined if you shift more than the number of bits in the number. i.e. `x << 33` or `x >> 33` is undefined if `x` is `int32_t` or `uint32_t` regardless of `x`.

!> † Most systems will do an arithmetic shift

!> †† Undefined if overflows/underflows will typically just underflow/overflow as expected though.

!> ⌊a⌋ means the floor of 'a' that is it rounds towards −∞

Undefined behaviour is really bad!!  So the rough idea here is avoid shifting negative numbers!!  Especially left shifting them!

## Q4) Flags

```c
#define READING   0x01
#define WRITING   0x02
#define AS_BYTES  0x04
#define AS_BLOCKS 0x08
#define LOCKED    0x10 // This is 16 it's hex! 0xF will be 15 so 1 more is 0x10
```

Write C to match each of the following WITHOUT conditionals!

1. Mark as locked for reading blocks
2. Mark as locked for writing blocks
3. Set it as locked but don't change current values
4. Remove lock leaving other flags unchanged
5. Toggle lock
6. If in read go to write, if in write go to read leaving other flags the same

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<p>
  Answers are below;

  1. `READING | LOCKED | AS_BLOCKS`
  2. `WRITING | LOCKED | AS_BLOCKS`
  3. `x |= LOCKED` (where x is the old value)
  4. `x &= ~LOCKED`
  5. `x ^= LOCKED`
  6. `x = x ^ READING ^ WRITING`

6 can be done in a much more complicated fashion to not do anything if in RD/WR or if RD/WR is off.  Effectively you'll detect if the bit is set using `&` and then shift it back into the other position (the way it's done means that if both are false then nothing gets set and if both are true the both get set anyways).

`x = (x & ~(READING | WRITING)) | ((x & READING) << 1) | ((x & WRITING) >> 1)`

</p>

## Q5) Lab Intro

```c
long l = strtol(argv[arg], NULL, 0);
assert(l >= INT16_MIN && l <= INT16_MAX);
int16_t value = l;

char *bits = sixteen_out(value);
printf("%s\n", bits);

free(bits);
```

## Q6) Reverse Bits

!> We don't have time to write each one, so I'll just show off 3 of them and talk about them.

There are a ridiculous number of ways of doing this, I'll show off 3;

?> Note: that we are using unsigned int, so it's 'atleast' 32 bits not exactly (on LLP64)

### 'obvious' way (swap every bit)

```c
#include <limits.h> // char_bit

typedef unsigned int Word;

// We can't presume the length of word so we'll just calculate it!
// CHAR_BIT is a constant inside of limits.h that is equal to the number of
// bits in a character, it's going to be 8 for all the systems you handle
// except if you handle really small systems where it may be 16.
// it's a bit of a lie because C also uses it as 'number of bits per byte'
// when that is always going to be '8' (it's a bit confusing but this is right)
#define SIZEOF_BITS(T) (sizeof(T) * CHAR_BIT)

Word reverseBits(Word word) {
    Word ret = 0;

    // Iterate through the bits one by one
    for (unsigned int bit = 0; bit < SIZEOF_BITS(Word); bit++) {
      // we in this case are accessing it like an 'index'
      // thus the last index is LEN - 1
      // Then we are creating a mask to extract just the single bit we want
      // for example 1u << 2 is 0b00000...0100 which will select the 3rd
      // bit (0 indexed!)
      Word mask = 1u << ((SIZEOF_BITS(Word) - 1) - bit);
      // '!!' is a common trick when you want to compress a value into a 0 or 1
      // '!0' => 1, therefore '!!0' => 0
      // '!x' (x != 0) => 0 therefore '!!x' => '!0' => 1
      // Once compressed down into a 0 or 1 we just move it back into position
      // then or that with ret.
      ret |= !!(word & mask) << bit;
    }

    return ret;
}
```

### Similar ish way that is a bit (heh) more efficient

```c
#include <limits.h> // char_bit

typedef unsigned int Word;
#define SIZEOF_BITS(T) (sizeof(T) * CHAR_BIT)

/**
  Here instead of finding which bit to copy across we are just moving the
  whole number to the right so that the bit we want to copy is the right most
  bit which is very easy to move!  Then we just move 'ret' to the left afterwards

  It is kinda like a conveyer belt
  Example:
    w = 1010 0101 1101
    r = 0000 0000 0000 // Copy the right most bit
    r = 0000 0000 0001 // Then shift r left one
    r = 0000 0000 0010 // Ready for next read, shift 'w' right one

    w = 0101 0010 1110 // do the write
    r = 0000 0000 0010 // shift r left one
    r = 0000 0000 0100 // shift w right one

    w = 0010 1001 0111 // copy bit
    r = 0000 0000 0101 // shift r left one
    r = 0000 0000 1010 // and so on

    ...
    r = 1011 1010 0101 // tada

    The only difference is it stops one there are no more 1's (i.e. w == 0)
    then it'll just shift by the remaining spaces instead of having to loop
    (speed improvement).
 **/

Word reverseBits(Word word) {
    Word ret = 0;

    // max number we can shift
    int max = SIZEOF_BITS(Word) - 1;

    // iterate while we still have '1's at all in the number
    // shift the word one by one to move the next bit to the first slot
    for (; word != 0; word >>= 1) {
      ret |= word & 1;
      ret <<= 1;
      max--;
    }

    // No more '1's left so we just shift by what's left
    return ret << max;
}
```

### Other way that has two moving masks

I kinda hate this solution it looks a lot more confusing then it deserves to be.  Regardless it'll appear in the solutions for this tute so I thought I'll cover it.

```c
typedef unsigned int Word;

/**
  The base idea is fine there are just some choices that make it much harder
  to understand!

  Roughly what you'll have is a single bit set in the very left most bit
  for 'left' and a bit set in the very right most bit for 'right'.

  Then all you will do is move the 'left' left and the 'right' right
  and read from one of them but write that result into the other!
 **/

Word reverseBits(Word word) {
  Word ret = 0;             // Reversed bit-string
  Word left = 1;            // Left moving mask
  // Trick to get around the whole CHAR_BIT thing
  // -1u will underflow making it the largest possible unsigned value (0xFF...)
  // therefore shifting that by 1 which makes the very left bit '0'
  // then we bitwise not the whole thing to make it so the very left bit is '1'
  // and the rest is '0'.
  // A much easier way of doing this is the CHAR_BIT method
  Word right = ~(-1u >> 1); // Right moving mask

  // while we still have our right cursor (it hasn't gone all the way off the right hand side)
  for (; right != 0; left <<= 1, right >>= 1) {
    // If the current bit of `w` is 1,
    // set the current bit of `ret` to 1
    if (word & left) {
      // set this bit
      ret |= right;
    }

    // a different way that'll 'may' be faster is;
    //ret |= -!!(word & left) & right; (this is slower on my machine)
    // or
    //ret |= !!(word & left) * right; (this is faster on my machine)
    // Why this is faster is a little interesting (I normally like avoiding
    // tricks that use underflow since they are confusing but here I think it's
    // fine).

    // The rough idea is that the '!!' will collapse it into a '0' or a '1'
    // then the '-' will turn the '1' into all bits set and the '0' into well
    // nothing, and then you 'and' that with the right to toggle the bit
    // that you want to set!
  }

  return ret;
}
```

### If we get some time!  Optimising this like crazy!

I got bored and decided to optimise this... (lmao)

I'll go through the benchmark code very briefly but you can find it [here](https://github.com/BraedonWooding/Comp1521-T2-2020/tree/master/Tute2)

The findings however are;

| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| 2.289 ±  0.005 | 0.008 ±  0.000 | 2.315 ±  0.005 |

This is mostly due to the fact that branches here aren't overly expensive because we have to conditionally branch anyway (fully branchless code is often much faster than code with branching in it but as soon as you have a branch often any speedups by removing it aren't great *roughly*)

| 1.896 ±  0.004 | 0.008 ±  0.001 | 1.928 ±  0.001 |

A big reason why this is so slow is because we have so many 0's at the front so it wastes a lot more time and has to iterate once for every single bit!  Where as the rest often skip a lot more.

If you run this however on a case with no right trailing 0's then it's performance becomes more inline with the faster ones and actually lies within error range (I'll show this off you can also run this yourself by swapping what lines are commented out on lines 93-94 and 95-96 in benchAlgos.c

## Quick Question

The rest of these questions are purely if we get time, we most certaintly won't get any time to go in depth so please let me know if you don't understand some of them (which ones preferably) so we can atleast covert those.

## Q7) What does this print

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  // feel free to presume this lives at address 0x7fff00000000
  // and that we are LLP64 (int = 4 bytes)
  int n[4] = { 42, 23, 11, 7 };
  int *p;

  p = &n[0];
  // What do these print?
  printf("%p\n", p);              // 0x7fff00000000
  printf("%lu\n", sizeof (int));  // 4

  // what do these statements print ?
  n[0]++;
  printf("%d\n", *p);             // 43
  p++;
  printf("%p\n", p);              // 0x7fff00000004
  printf("%d\n", *p);             // 23

  return 0;
}
```

## Q8) What does this print?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  char *str = "abc123\n";

  for (char *c = str; *c != '\0'; c++) {
    putchar(*c);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

!> abc123

And an extension of above what does the following do?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  char *str = "abc123\n";
  char *c;

  for (c = str; *c != '\0'; c++) {}

  // zu is just a size_t print
  // technically sizeof(size_t) isn't always equal to sizeof(uintptr_t)
  // (when isn't it??)
  // but for our purposes in this course you can presume it is
  printf("%zu\n", c - str);

  return 0;
}
```

!> 7

## Q9) Structs what do they do :O

```c
typedef struct coord_t {
    int x;
    int y;
    int z;
} Coord;

int main(void) {{
  Coord coords[10] = {};
  Coord a = { .x = 5, .y = 6, .z = 7 };
  Coord b = { .x = 3, .y = 3, .z = 3 };
  Coord *p = &a;

  // What is the value of a, b, p here?
  /*** A ***/
  (*p).x = 6;
  p->y++;
  p->z++;
  b = *p;
  /*** B ***/
  // what is the value of a, b, p here?
}
```

### For A

- a is  { .x = 5, .y = 6, .z = 7 };
- b is  { .x = 3, .y = 3, .z = 3 };
- p is &{ .x = 5, .y = 6, .z = 7 }; (address of a)

### For B

- a is  { .x = 6, .y = 7, .z = 8 };
- b is  { .x = 6, .y = 7, .z = 8 }; (copy of a/p)
- p is &{ .x = 6, .y = 7, .z = 8 }; (address of a)

Extension questions on above:

- Why is `*p.z++` 'incorrect' compared to either `(*p).z++` or `p->z++`

Because the `*` just applies to the whole (p.z++) rather than just p

- Write some code to iterate over the array using just `p`, do not use an index!
  - There are a few ways here try to be a bit ingenious!
  - Feel free to take constant indexes such as `&coords[10]` but do not use a counter as an index since it defeats the purpose.

## Q10) Theory pointers

Consider the following;

```c
int  x;  // a variable located at address 1000 with initial value 0
int *p;  // a variable located at address 2000 with initial value 0
```

What is the state of `x` and `p` post each of these operations;

- `p = &x;`
- `x = 5;`
- `*p = 3;`
- `x = (int)p;` (is this even legal?)
- `x = (int)&p;` (^^ same question)
- `p = NULL;`
- `*p = 1;`

!> Warning about the casting to int!

- `x = 0`, `p = 1000`
- `x = 5`, `p = 1000`
- `x = 3`, `p = 1000`
- `x = 1000`, `p = 1000` (yes because `p` has a value that can narrow to int if it was too large it would be undefined behaviour)
- `x = 2000`, `p = 1000`
- `p = 0, x = 2000`
- segfault (can't modify null)

6. The variable f exists only while fun2 is "executing" (including during the call to fun1 from inside fun2)
7. The variable g exists for the entire duration of program execution

## Q12) Where are the following stored?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

char *s1 = "abc";

int main(void) {
    char s2[] = "def";
    // ...
}
```

Have a look here!

## Q13) What is the difference between

```c
void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);
// vs
void *malloc(size_t size);
```

A few more questions

- What does `malloc(0)` return?  Do you know what size it'll be?
  - A hint: must it give you a unique address?
- What does `realloc(NULL, 20)` return?  Does it free the NULL pointer?
  - A hint: does it matter if it tries?
- What kind of bugs can realloc create?
  - What's a really simple way you can detect realloc bugs?

## Q14) Expand!

```c
#define LIFE 42
#define VAL random() % 20

#define sq(x) (x * x)
#define woof(y) (LIFE + y)

int main(void) {
  char s[LIFE];
  int i = woof(5);
  i = VAL;
  return (sq(i) > LIFE) ? 1 : 0;
}
```

What C would you expect from `gcc -E prog.c` (you can ignore extra directives)

## Q15) Static :D

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// What does this mean?
static int x1;
...

// What does this mean?
static int f(int n) {
  // What does this mean?
  static int x2 = 0;
  ...
}
```

## Q16) Blocks

```c
// 1)
if (x == 0) {
  printf ("zero\n");
}

// 2)
if (x == 0)
  printf ("zero\n");

// 3)
if (x == 0) {
  printf ("zero\n");
  printf ("after\n");
}

// 4)
if (x == 0)
  printf ("zero\n");
  printf ("after\n");
```

What is the difference for the above statements?

## Q17) Errors

C functions have many ways to handle errors such as;

- errno
- termination (abort)
- returning a sentinel that denotes an error (NULl, EOF, ...)
- signal interrupts
- setting a passed pointer parameter

For the following;

```c
int n, a, b, c;
n = scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
```

What is the value of each for;

- `42 64 999`
- `42 64.4 999`
- `42 64 hello`
- `42 hello there`
- `hello there`
- `<EOF>` (as in literally EOF or Ctrl + D)

## Q18) Write an get_int function and talk about various different ways to handle errors

A few questions

- Leading spaces?  Trailing spaces?  Do you care?
- We are returning an `int` here, is a sentinel value good?
- Can we just crash?  Or take an argument?

## Q19) Compiling!

For each of the following;

- `gcc -E x.c`
- `gcc -S x.c`
- `gcc -c x.c`
- `gcc x.c`

What do they produce for the following code;

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define N 10

int main(void) {
  char str[N] = { 'H', 'i', '\0' };
  printf("%s\n", str);
  return 0;
}
```

<summary>Answer/Hint</summary>
<p>
  Look at below and change the compiler options (you don't need to add the `x.c`).  You may not notice a difference for `-c` and `-s`.
