# Tute 5

Comparing interfaces, abstract, and concrete classes;

- Which can be constructed?
- Which can have abstract methods?
- Which can have concrete methods?
- Which can have fields?
- How do they relate in terms of inheritance + realisation

I don't really like the tute questions this week otherwise so we'll do something different :).
