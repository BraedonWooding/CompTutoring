# Tute 3

## Assignment

I'll talk about the assignment for a bit.

## Refactor List

Refactor the code in lists.ListExample to use Java's List's.

> We'll also look at clever ways to solve the last one since that's a little bit more tricky

## Overriding Rules

In both of these what get's executed by the main function

```java
public class A {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    C c = new C();
    c.speak();
    B b = c;
    b.speak();
    b = new B();
    b.speak();
    c.speak();
  }
}

public class B {
  public void speak() {
    System.out.println("moo");
  }
}

public class C extends B {
  public void speak() {
    System.out.println("quack");
  }
}
```

```java
public class A {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    B b1 = new B();
    B b2 = new B();
    b1.incX();
    b2.incY();
    System.out.println(b1.getX() + " " + b1.getY());
    System.out.println(b2.getX() + " " + b2.getY());
  }
}

public class B {
  private int x;
  private static int y;

  public int getX() {
    return x;
  }

  public int getY() {
    return y;
  }

  public void incX() {
    x++;
  }

  public void incY() {
    y++;
  }
}
```

## Rest of tute

We went through more tute last week (I felt it was more relevant).

So this tute we are going to go through UML and some basic design tips :D.

I'll update the tute notes later (we'll just play it by ear)
