## Introductions

## Consider the following C program skeleton

```c
int  a;
char b[100];

int fun1() {
    int c, d;
    // ...
}

double e;

int fun2() {
    int f;
    static int ff;
    // ...
    fun1();
    // ...
}

unsigned int g;

int main(void) {
    char h[10];
    int i;
    // ...
    fun2();
    // ...
}
```

1. Which variables are accessible from within main()?
2. Which variables are accessible from within fun2()?
3. Which variables are accessible from within fun1()?
4. Which variables are deallocated when fun1() returns?
5. Which variables are deallocated when fun2() returns?
6. How long does the variable f exist during program execution?
7. How long does the variable g exist during program execution?

    <li>a, b, e, g since they are all globals and h, i since they are local to main</li>
    <li>a, b, e since they are global and f, ff since they are are local.  Can't access g since it's declared 'after' fun2, if you moved 'g' or provided an definition via an `extern` variable you could access it</li>
    <li>a, b since they are global, and c, d since they are local.  Same reasons as above for why we can't access e, g</li>
    <li>c, d since they are locally defined they'll be stack allocated (or registers but don't mind too much about that)</li>
    <li>only f since it's a local.  ff is static so it's lifetime is bound to the lifetime of the program meaning it's effectively just a global that only fun2 can see</li>
    <li>only for duration of fun2</li>
    <li>lifetime of program</li>

## Storage

What is the difference in the storage of below

```c
#include <stdio.h>

char *s1 = "abc";

int main(void) {
    char s2[] = "def";
    // ...
}
```

Have a look here!

- `s1` will be allocated in writeable data (`.data`) but it's data `"abc"` will be located in read only memory (.rdata) you don't have to care about this last bit, effectively though the string won't be stack allocated.  You can think of `s1` as existing on a psuedo stack that exists for duration of program. `s1` will be 4 bytes for MIPS32 and 8 bytes on your machine (since you are probably running x86_64 architecture).
- `s2` fully stack allocated and will be 4 bytes (since there are 3 characters + `\0`).  The string `"def"` will be stored semi similiarly to how `"abc"` worked and it'll use a memcpy to place it into `s2` you could also just write the bits manually (which is what most optimising compilers do) as we showed in the tute.

## Compiler Commands

For each of the following;

- `gcc -E x.c`
- `gcc -S x.c`
- `gcc -c x.c`
- `gcc x.c`

What do they produce for the following code;

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define N 10

int main(void) {
  char str[N] = { 'H', 'i', '\0' };
  printf("%s\n", str);
  return 0;
}
```

<details>
<summary>Answer/Hint</summary>

Look at below and change the compiler options (you don't need to add the `x.c`).  You may not notice a difference for `-c` and `-s`.
  
The answer is that;

- `E` expands macros and #includes but won't produce any executable code (just produces expanded C basically)
- `S` produces a `x.s` file containing the assembly (machine/architecture dependent)
- `c` produces a `x.o` file that is unlinked but is machine relocatable (machine/architecture dependent)
- the 'nothing' option i.e. `gcc x.c` will produce linked executable

## Do braces matter?

What does each of these print

```c
if (x == 0) {
    printf ("zero\n");
}
```

```c
if (x == 0)
    printf ("zero\n");
```

```c
if (x == 0)
    printf ("zero\n");
    printf ("after\n");
```

```c
if (x == 0) {
    printf ("zero\n");
    printf ("after\n");
}
```

1 and 2 are identical.

But 3 and 4 are not, the reason why is that when you don't have the `{}` (braces) it'll kind of 'auto insert' them around the next statement (a statement ends with a `;`) so in the case of 3 it will do the following;

```c
if (x == 0) {
    printf ("zero\n");
}
printf ("after\n");
```

Which clearly will differ compared to 4.  Indentation doesn't matter in C programs for determining what happens it's purely style.

## Memory Address Recap

What does the following program print if you presume `n` is at address `0x7fff00000000`

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int n[4] = { 42, 23, 11, 7 };
    int *p;

    p = &n[0];
    printf("%p\n", p); // prints 0x7fff00000000
    printf("%lu\n", sizeof (int)); // prints 4

    // what do these statements print ?
    n[0]++;
    printf("%d\n", *p);
    p++;
    printf("%p\n", p);
    printf("%d\n", *p);

    return 0;
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int n[4] = { 42, 23, 11, 7 };
    int *p;

    p = &n[0];
    printf("%p\n", p); // prints 0x7fff00000000
    printf("%lu\n", sizeof (int)); // prints 4

    // what do these statements print ?
    n[0]++;
    // p = &n[0] = &*(n + 0) = n + 0 = n
    // so when we increment the first element in 'n'
    // we would also expect that the value of *p to change
    // since they are effectively the same object
    
    printf("%d\n", *p); // 43
    p++;
    // ^^ Moves the pointer to the next integer
    // each integer is 4 bytes so this will move it by 4 address spaces
    // (each address 'space' is a byte)
    
    printf("%p\n", p);  // 0x7fff00000000 + 4 = 0x7fff00000004
    
    // vv Since we have moved to the next position
    // the value of '*p' will be equal to *(n + 1) since p originally equaled
    // n, in this case it means *p == 23.
    printf("%d\n", *p); // 23

    return 0;
}
```

## Pointer Arithmetic

```c
int  x;  // a variable located at address 1000 with initial value 0
int *p;  // a variable located at address 2000 with initial value 0
```

Now perform each of the following operations noting the values of x, p after each one.

- `p = &x`
- `x = 5`
- `*p = 3`
- `x = (int)p`
- `x = (int)&p`
- `p = NULL`
- `*p = 1`

<details>
<summary> Answers </summary>

```c
int  x;  // a variable located at address 1000 with initial value 0
int *p;  // a variable located at address 2000 with initial value 0

p = &x;
// the address of x is 1000 (as per above comments) so when we set p to that
// we are setting the 'value' of the pointer 'p'.  This is potentially
// confusing since p effectively has 3 values in it.  The location of the
// pointer `p`, the value of `p` (the address of what it points to) and the
// dereference of `p` (i.e. *p) which is the value of what it points to.

// In this case we are modifying the address of what it points to (now it
// points to x) but we aren't modifying it's location nor the value of what
// it points to.

// Thus
// x is located at address 1000 with value 0 (unchanged)
// p is located at address 2000 with value 1000, with *p = 0 (since x = 0)

x = 5
// Now 'x' is 5 so
// x is located at address 1000 with value 5 (modified)
// BUT p is still located at address 2000 still holding value 1000
// however *p now is '5'

*p = 3
// This is effectively doing x = 3.  Since p points to x when we dereference
// and modify it we are modifying the value AT the location of 'x' this means
// that;
// x is located at address 1000 but now holds value 3 (modified)
// AND p is located at address 2000 with value 1000 (unchanged)
// BUT *p is now 3 (as one would expect).

x = (int)p
// the value at x is going to be set to the value of p since the value of p
// is &x this is effectively x = (int)&x; which is just going to set x to 1000
// Thus:
// x is located at address 1000 but now holds value 1000 (modified)
// p is located at address 2000 with value 1000 (unchanged) BUT *p is now 1000
//
// Side Note:
//  Casts like this are typically dangerous / bad because it relies
//  on the fact that in this specific case the addresses of both values
//  small, you can't rely on this for a modern computer with > 4 GB ram.
//  If the value is larger than an int (possible / probable on most modern)
//  then this 'cast' will cause the data to narrow loosing information and
//  either overflowing or truncating both causing you to get an invalid
//  interpretation.
// In most cases using uintptr_t, size_t or long long is preferred for ptrs
// (in that order of preference) for this course you can / will see size_t
// but any is 'fine'

x = (int)&p
// Similar to above (with similar side note issues)
// in this case x will now hold the address of p which is 2000 therefore
// x is located at address 1000 but now holds value 2000 (modified)
// p is located at address 2000 with value 1000 (unchanged) BUT *p is now 2000

p = NULL
// Setting p to NULL will have no impact on x since we are setting the
// 'value' of p i.e. we are moving / pointing it elsewhere therefore
// x is located at address 1000 but now holds value 2000 (unchanged)
// p is located at address 2000 with value 0 (or NULL) (modified)
//
// Side Note: C doesn't technically define that NULL is 0 so the system
//            could use a different value for NULL (and some older and
//            lower level / barebones systems do) however it does define
//            that '0' for all pointers is NULL so you can always compare
//            a pointer to 0 as equivalent to a NULL check and it'll fix that
//            up in the event that NULL != 0

*p = 1
// Since p == NULL, *p will cause a crash (SEGFAULT probably) due to
// the fact that NULL is not a valid pointer location.
```
