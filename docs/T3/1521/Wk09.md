## Assignment 2

> How are you all going with it?

## Filesystem

Briefly just find some interesting parts of the below graph / tree

![Filesystem](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/20T3/tut/09/q-fs-objects/filesystem.png)

## `stat`/`lstat`

On Linux the struct that these give looks something along this idea (some fields are left out for brevity)

```c
struct stat {
	ino_t st_ino;         /* inode number */
	mode_t st_mode;       /* protection */
	uid_t st_uid;         /* user ID of owner */
	gid_t st_gid;         /* group ID of owner */
	off_t st_size;        /* total size, in bytes */
	blksize_t st_blksize; /* blocksize for filesystem I/O */
	blkcnt_t st_blocks;   /* number of 512B blocks allocated */
	time_t st_atime;      /* time of last access */
	time_t st_mtime;      /* time of last modification */
	time_t st_ctime;      /* time of last status change */
};
```

What are the properties for the below file;

```bash
$ ls -ls stat.c
8 -rw-r--r--  1 jas  cs1521  1855  Sep  9 14:24 stat.c
```

Who can access each of the following;

```
drwxr-x--- 11 cs1521 cs1521 4096 Aug 27 11:59 17s2.work
drwxr-xr-x  2 cs1521 cs1521 4096 Aug 20 13:20 bin
-rw-r-----  1 cs1521 cs1521   38 Jul 20 14:28 give.spec
drwxr-xr-x  3 cs1521 cs1521 4096 Aug 20 13:20 lib
drwxr-x--x  3 cs1521 cs1521 4096 Jul 20 10:58 public_html
drwxr-xr-x 12 cs1521 cs1521 4096 Aug 13 17:31 spim
drwxr-x---  2 cs1521 cs1521 4096 Sep  4 15:18 tmp
lrwxrwxrwx  1 cs1521 cs1521   11 Jul 16 18:33 web -> public_html
```

?> What is the difference between `lstat` and `stat` for a symbolic link like `web` here.

## Sanity Checker

Often we don't want paths to be 'publically writeable' because that means any person could come and modify our files!  So have a look at the path and if it's publically writeable then remove that permission!

## Simple `ls`

This is mainly intended to help with the assignment :)

We'll write an `ls` look alike, it'll iterate through all given files (expanding directories) and printing out the name, size, and permissions in octal.

It'll be a good chunk of work but we'll see how much we can do :)
