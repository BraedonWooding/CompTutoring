There are so many questions it's unlikely we'll be able to cover everything.

So I'm just going to put some important questions here and we'll cover the other ones if we get time.  Have a look [here](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1521/20T2/flask_tutors.cgi/tut/10/questions) for all questions.

## `getenv` + Environmental Variables

Write a program that prints out the contents of a diary located at `$HOME/.diary`

## LRU + Virtual Memory

### Lab Code

```c
// Simulate LRU replacement of page frames

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <assert.h>


// represent an entry in a simple inverted page table

typedef struct ipt_entry {
    int virtual_page;        // == -1 if physical page free
    int last_access_time;
} ipt_entry_t;


void lru(int n_physical_pages, int n_virtual_pages);
void access_page(int virtual_page, int access_time, int n_physical_pages, struct ipt_entry *ipt);

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc != 3) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <n-physical-pages> <n-virtual-pages>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }
    lru(atoi(argv[1]), atoi(argv[2]));
    return 0;
}


void lru(int n_physical_pages, int n_virtual_pages) {
    printf("Simulating %d pages of physical memory, %d pages of virtual memory\n",
          n_physical_pages, n_virtual_pages);
    struct ipt_entry *ipt = malloc(n_physical_pages * sizeof *ipt);
    assert(ipt);

    for (int i = 0; i < n_physical_pages; i++) {
        ipt[i].virtual_page = -1;
        ipt[i].last_access_time = -1;
    }

    int virtual_page;
    for (int access_time = 0; scanf("%d", &virtual_page) == 1; access_time++) {
        assert(virtual_page >= 0 && virtual_page < n_virtual_pages);
        access_page(virtual_page, access_time, n_physical_pages, ipt);
    }
}


// if virtual_page is not in ipt, the first free page is used
// if there is no free page, the least-recently-used page is evicted
//
// a single line of output describing the page access is always printed
// the last_access_time in ipt is always updated

void access_page(int virtual_page, int access_time, int n_physical_pages, struct ipt_entry *ipt) {

    // PUT YOUR CODE HERE TO HANDLE THE 3 cases
    //
    // 1) The virtual page is already in a physical page
    //
    // 2) The virtual page is not in a physical page,
    //    and there is free physical page
    //
    // 3) The virtual page is not in a physical page,
    //    and there is no free physical page
    //
    // don't forgot to update the last_access_time of the virtual_page

    printf("Time %d: virtual page %d accessed\n", access_time, virtual_page);
}
```

Let's say we have 6 virtual memory pages and 4 physical memory pages what will happen if these virtual memory pages were accessed

5 3 5 3 0 1 2 2 3 5

## Processes

?> Which parts contain contain initial values? (Code/Data/Heap/Stack) Which parts can be modified?

### Older Method

An old approach is to not use paging and load all programs into a single blob.

![Process](assets/img/process.png)

> Doing this requires a rewrite of addresses to be pointed to the base.

For the above image relocate the below code if A = 0x8000.

```nasm
   li  $t0, 0
   li  $t1, 0
   li  $t2, 20  # elements in array
loop1:  # located at 0x1028
   bge $t1, $t2, end_loop1
   mul $t3, $t1, 4
   la  $t4, array
   add $t3, $t3, $t4
   lw  $t3, ($t3)
   add $t1, $t1, $t3
   add $t1, $t1, 1
   j   loop1
end_loop1:

.data
    array: .space 80 # 20 * 4, located at 0x2000
```

### More recent method 

?> What's a virtual address compared to a physical one?

![Process](assets/img/process2.png)

The low byte address in the process is 0 (in Code1) and the top byte address in the process is 28671 (max address in page containing Stack2).

For each of the following process addresses (in decimal notation), determine what physical address it maps to.

1. `jal func`, where the label func is at 5096
2. `lw $s0,($sp)`, where `$sp` contains 28668
3. `la $t0, msg`, where the label msg is at 10192

### Page Faults

Consider the following;

```c
int bigArray[100000];
// ...
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
	sum += bigArray[i];
}
```

?> Assuming pages are 4 KiB, and that the above code fits on a single page how large is the working set?

?> Assuming that the code is already in memory, but none of big array is loaded how many page faults are expected?

## Page Tables

- 5 pages, 4 frames

Like below;

![Process](assets/img/pagetable.png)

Show page table after each operation;

```
read page0,  read page4,  read page0,  write page4,  read page1,
read page3,  read page2,  write page2,  read page1,  read page0,
```

## Extension (if we get time) Redirection

Show how `cat file` compares to `cat < file` and how the OS / Shell makes that work.
