# Week 4

## Braedon's Introduction to MIPS

I do a different introduction to MIPS then the tutorial notes!

So this is a rough skeleton of what I'll talk about (to keep me focused).

I'll try to aim to come back here later and give a rough overview of what I said :).

### Instruction Sets

...
 
### RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) vs CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)

...

### Branch Prediction and Pipelining and Caches (and possibly other optimisations)

...

### Cost of common latency numbers

If you want to write fast programs I would argue it's essential to get a feeling for [these](https://colin-scott.github.io/personal_website/research/interactive_latency.html)

> In summary computers are really really fast ;)

## Registers

> What are registers?

Let's cover the main ones

1. `$0`
2. `$1`
3. `$2`
4. `$4`
5. `$8`
6. `$16`
7. `$26`
8. `$29`
9. `$31`

## What registers do you need to remember?

- `$0`
- `$v0`/`$v1`
- `$a0..3`
- `$t0..9`
- `$s0..7`
- `$sp`, `$fp`
- `$ra`

### Exam Tips

> These should only be applied to exams.  In a non stressful context take your time and write good MIPS.

1. Registers are like global variables, you can use them as such.  This isn't good style, but in exams / under pressure they can be very fast and save you a lot of time (and errors) from stack manipulation.  Feel free to give 1 or 2 registers to special values that are going to consist through functions (and that are shared prevents you having to push/pop pointers to stack/data memory).
2. `$fp` does make code cleaner but in an exam setting I much much prefer to just use it as a spare register.
3. `$at` can be sometimes used too ^^ but only once you have more knowledge of what the psuedo ops are.  (Again not good style)
4. Always begin with the rough C code
5. Don't worry about commenting every line, just comment blocks (for exams)

## Translating C to MIPS

These are loosely based on the tute Qs.

### IO

Translate this C program to MIPS

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    /* 'registers' */ int x, y, z;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &x);
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &y);
    
    z = x + y;
    printf("%d\n", z);
    return 0;
}
```

### Conditionals

How do we translate conditionals in MIPS?

```c
// Translate below using both methods
if (1 > 2) {
    printf("It holds!");
} else {
    printf("It doesn't hold");
}
```

What is the best way to translate it if there was no else?

> It's up to you, I almost always prefer to do it the flip way.  It just makes more logical sense to me.

Furthermore how do we handle the following?

```c
if (1 > 2 && (10 == 9 || 9 > 0)) {
    printf("yay");
}
```

HINT: Break it down to simpler C where each branch is a single condition and you may want to use a goto

```c
if (1 > 2) {
    // This is pretty easy part
    // the && becomes nested 'if'
    // the || is tricky so there are two ways
    // 1) we can keep it as OR and use bitwise |
    //    like OR $1, $2, $3 => $1 = $2 | $3
    //    so in our case we would break each sub statement
    //    and place result into $t0, $t1 then do something like
    //    OR $t0, $t0, $t1 ; BEQZ $t0, _else
    // 2) we just put the two checks after each other
    //    BNE 10, 9, _else; BLE 9, 0, _else (and you can use BLEZ int his case)
}

_else:
```

### Loops

```c
// print a triangle
#include <stdio.h>

int main (void) {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            printf("*");
        }
        printf("\n");
    };
    return 0;
}
```

### (If we get time) function introduction

```c
// Don't use the stack yet just use registers
// Think about where we can put $ra in the meantime
// in the future we'll do this much nicer.
#include <stdio.h>

int add(int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
}

int main(void) {
    /* 'registers' */ int x, y, z;

    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &x);
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &y);
    
    z = add(x, y);
    printf("%d\n", z);
    return 0;
}
```
