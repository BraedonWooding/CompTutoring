# JavaFX

## Immediate vs Retained

Immediate is all about redrawing each frame, where as Retained is all about retaining changes between each frame.

Immediate is often more convient for developers and is easier to write, it can be less performant if a drawing cycle is particularly expensive but implementations such as Dear IMGUI (C++) demonstrate that you can build performant implementations with care.  Downside is it doesn't play with a lot of MVC/OOP principles nicely without the use of transactional snapshots.

Retained is often harder to reason about but can be more convient for very uncoupled UIs (i.e. an enemy that moves around), it plays into observer pattern nicely and typically follows OOP much more heavily.

Both are valid (I personally prefer Immediate) JavaFX is a retained UI with aspects that make it seem immediate.
