# Tutorial 07 - Solutions

## A. Finding Patterns

In groups, determine a possible pattern that could be used to solve each of the following problems:

- Sorting collections of records in different orders.
- Modelling a file system
- Updating a UI component when the state of a program changes.
- Parsing and evaluating arithmetic expressions.
- Adjusting the brightness of a screen based on a light sensor.

## B. Composite Pattern

Inside `src/calculator`, use the Composite Pattern to write a simple calculator that evaluates an expression. Your calculator should be able to:

- Add two expressions
- Subtract two expressions
- Multiply two expressions
- Divide two expressions

There should be a `Calculator` class as well which can be passed in an expression, and calculate that expression.

Design a solution, create stubs, write failing unit tests, then implement the functions.

## C. Parser

Let's write a very simple parser for our calculator here and chat about factory patterns and composite patterns.
