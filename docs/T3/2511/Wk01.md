# Week 1

Welcome to Week 1 of 2511.  Make sure your computer is all setup (check the home computing section on the left).

!> This week we won't diverge from the recommended tute but in the future I will include harder content that is more likely to appear on exams / assignments as well as try to supply an alternate position for things.

## Questions

1. What are the similarities and differences between C, Python and Java? Think in terms of the languages themselves but also style conventions and what they are used for?

### Back to questions

2. What is a class? What is an object? Based on your experience with Python, how are classes typically used?

3. How do C, Python and Java compare to other languages you may have encountered at CSE or elsewhere? Is the best way of doing something in one language necessarily the best way of doing it in another?

## Programming

1. Briefly, what is an IDE?

2. Write a program that uses the `Scanner` class to read in a line of numbers separated by spaces and sums them.

3. Write a class that stores a message and has methods for getting the message, updating the message, printing it out and printing it out in all caps. Write a `main()` method for testing this class.
